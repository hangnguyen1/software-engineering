						<ol>
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>If your pet strays from home, it can be a devastating experience for both you
						and your pet. You should <FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">act immediately</FONT> because the longer you wait,
						the further away your pet can travel and the higher probability they could get injured.</B></li>
													
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>We encourage you to use our service as well
						as review all the important tips below and take the necessary actions. The best way to locate your lost
						pet is to do as much as possible, you never know exactly how you will find your pet so never give up and
						try as many possible things as you can think of to locate your lost pet.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>First, make sure you have properly searched your <FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">
						OWN</FONT> home to confirm your pet is not just hiding somewhere. Make sure to check any garages, basements and sheds on the property, even
						if you don't think your pet could have gotten in there. Pets can get into some very strange
						and small places. Look behind, under and inside all appliances such as washing machines, stoves,
						refrigerators. For cats, make sure to check in attics, on the roof or roof gutters, and up in trees.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">Search your neighborhood</FONT>, knock on doors and talk to all your neighbors. Leave
						a phone number with them in case they find your pet at a later time. Walk, ride a bicycle or drive
						slowly through your neighborhood and make some noise while you go around the neighborhood (call the
						pet's name also). Animals can hear you from very long distances. Bring your pets favorite things
						with you, a "squeaky" toy or favorite treats and rattle them loudly while calling your pet's name.
						It's also important to stop regularly, be quiet, and listen to see if your pet is making any noise.
						Sometimes they may make a noise in reply or they may be hiding somewhere whimpering or barking.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">Post signs at intersections</FONT> and around your neighborhood. Place signs within a
						2-mile radius of where your pet was lost. You can also post signs at grocery stores, pet stores,
						vet offices, and apartment complexes. Don't put your name or address on the flyer, but make sure
						there is contact info such as a phone number and/or email address. Put a color photo preferably
						and include the date and where the pet was lost as well as a couple distinguishing marks. Don't
						include all distinguishing marks, withhold some marks and characteristics so if someone does call
						you can verify that they actually found your pet by telling you some distinguishing marks. Include
						the breed of dog or cat, sex, age, weight and color, use bright colored paper for higher visibility.
						Give copies of your flier to people that walk their dogs in the area. They're more likely to spot
						animals than most people. If you go to the parks early, you may find people who regularly walk their
						dogs together as an informal group.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">Go to all the local shelters</FONT> within a 20-mile radius and the government agencies
						charged with picking up stray and lost animals and look for yourself, at least every other day.
						Calling the animal control department or shelter on the phone is not very effective. Your pet  may
						not yet be listed in the records at the front desk, and the way you describe your pet may not be the
						way a shelter describes your dog or pet. Any animal may become dirty,  matted and neglected looking
						very quickly, and you must visit the shelter, even if your pet was wearing tags when it was lost.
						You should go to the shelters at least every other day. Few shelters can keep animals for more than
						72 hours. Sometimes it takes more than a few days for a pet to be picked up and brought to a shelter.
						It's important to visit all the shelters within 20 miles of where your pet was lost.  In many areas
						stray animals are picked up by a government agency which holds them for a period and then turns them
						over to a shelter. If someone took your pet in for a few days hoping you would knock on their door 
						and ask about it, they might later drop your pet off at the shelter that's most convenient for them,
						rather the one that's closest.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">Use the Power of Scent:</FONT> Place a recently worn article of clothing belonging to a
						family member or the lost pet's unwashed bedding in your yard or outside your front door where the
						breeze can carry the scent. Familiar scents can bring them home. Cats will respond to an open can of
						tuna fish or litter box also.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Contact veterinary clinics both in your area and surrounding areas. An animal
						could have been injured, rescued and taken out of the area in any direction for some distance so
						check them thoroughly and often.</B></li>						

						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">Place an advertisement</FONT> in your local and community newspapers, some will even
						place ads for free. Check often columns dealing with "lost and found" and animals for at least two
						months. Advertise on both Sunday as well as during the week as some people on get the Sunday paper.
						Make sure you also check the newspaper's found section as most newspapers will provide free ads for
						people who have found lost pets.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT CLASS="normal-grey-12b">ID Tags:</FONT> If your pet's ID tags have an old address and phone, contact the people
						who now live at that address and now have that phone number - even if they are out-of-town numbers.
						Let them know your pet is missing and give them your current information. Check back with them
						occasionally, in case they lose your information. If your pet has current information on his ID tags,
						follow all these tips anyway. Collars come off very easily and he may no longer have ID on them.</B></li>
						
						<li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Unfortunately, you must also check to find out if your pet has been fatally injured on the
						road. This is very sad, but necessary as you may never know otherwise and it's best to know if they
						passed on. The road crews for your local and state department of transportation (DOT) are usually in
						charge of picking up deceased animals from the roadside and city streets. Sometimes Animal Control will
						also do this, so check with them. Dogs are picked up quicker than cats, usually within 24 hours, so
						check with them everyday to see if they have found them.</B><P></li>
